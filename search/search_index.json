It is by no means comprehensive, and it relies on the experience of the group. Initial structure Most simulations are based on one or more experimental structures, and one may use homology modelling to for certain parts. Important to remember that none of these are perfect. Generally, it is advisable to collect the structures related to the state the model is to be created for and determine a consensus structure. Sometimes certain regions are patched from other, even loosely homologous proteins. Making an explicit atomistic model Structures are seldom atomistically explicit, as hydrogens are typically resolved. There are multiple aspects of creating a complete model: Proteins, nucleic acids Biomolecules are heavily studied with molecular mechanics, therefore force fields and tools are prepared for helping us create an atomistic model. Note that these often rely on the residue and atom names. Adding missing atoms and explicit hydrogens are usually part of any software's preparation pipeline. Protonation state Pay extra attention to protic and polar moieties. Propka is a good starting point to set up the protonation state, it is advisable to inspect the structure wherever a discrepancy is suggested from the expected protonation state. Furthermore, histidines have a tiny difference between the delta and epsilon states, therefore the local environment is to be studied to decide which is more favourable. There are more comprehensive tools to optimise the overall H-bonding network, e.g. the protein preparation wizard of the Schr\u00f6dinger Suite. Ion sites, crystallographic waters For a correct setup, collecting all available structures are especially important in this regard. Some ions, like Mg2+ will require an octahedral coordination, which may need to be completed by water molecules. Others, like Zn2+, prefer tetrahedral, which is difficult to maintain by formal charge non-bonding interaction setups. Special force field patches can be employed to address this, e.g. ZAFF . Depending on the software, implementing these may require a modification to the topology. Also pay attention to other waters, as some may have a structural role in positions hardly accessible from bulk or for the solvation algorithms. Ligands, substrates Unlike biomolecules, the connectivity is not straightforward from ligand 3D structures, therefore dedicated attention is needed for correct bond orders. Several all atom force fields or parametrisation options are available. The easiest improvement on these are using QM calculated (R)ESP charges. It is important to note, that in some cases molecular symmetry is not automatically considered. Protonation state Crucially, ligand protonation has to be set up correctly. Beyond chemical intuition, pKa estimators for small molecules are available, e.g. Epik in Schr\u00f6dinger or a free tool within Marvin sketch. Equilibration The general experience is, the slower, the better. After solvation and electrolite setup, a minimisation can help to remove a degree of clashes, a check of the crucial structural details is always advisable. It is often a good strategy to separate the equilibration of certain degrees of freedom by applying some extra restraints which are then gradually released. The decision on this is highly contextual, based on the source of the initial structure and the goal of the simulation. Although simulations often supposed to be ergodic, running replicas is generally helpful for sampling. D.

Zn 2+ has 10 valence electrons, which warrants a tetrahedral coordination with four two-electron donors. Typically, these are (deprotonated) cysteines or histidines, sometimes can be alcohol sidechains or water. These moieties are often called Zn fingers. MM force fields generally rely on describing ion binding by non-bonding interactions, electrostatics and van der Waals. This often breaks down with Zn fingers, partly because they do not account for the covalent character of the binding and because they ignore the charge transfer from Lewis base to acid. Therefore, keeping the formal 2+ charge on the zinc creates an electrostatic well polling in negative particles, and since the size exclusion allows enough space for six ligands, often results in an octahedral coordination around the metal ion. ZAFF Zinc Amber Force Field (ZAFF) was developed to handle these issues, a useful tutorial is available for its usage. It describes 12 different Zn fingers, varied in the type and protonation of the coordinating residues. Further combinations can be created either based on these parameters, or by carrying out QM calculations, especially for getting the (RESP) charges. Implementation There are two major changes that are required for using the modified FF, apart from the obvious deprotonation of coordinating cysteins (CYS->CYM). One is the modification of the system topology, including the 2-3-4 atom interactions involving the zinc. The other one is modifying the charges, which, depending on the software environment, may require the definition of one-off residue types, see the amber example . NAMD I discuss the usage in NAMD, as our preferred MD engine, especially with the CHARMM36m forcefield shipped from CHARMM-GUI CHARMM also implemented extra parameters for the Zn fingers, part of the toppar_all36_prot_modify_res.str compilation. Here the bonding, angle and dihedral parameters are set for S and N atoms, assuming CYM and HIS (HSD or HSE) coordination. To use these, the psf file of the system has to be modified: registering the index of the atoms involved, doubles, triples and quadrupoles for bonds, angles and dihedrals are to be added to their respective sections, so the software will invoke these parameters. Although this modification could be scripted, we have not done that as it only has to be done once for a psf . (Some classical MD software register only the parameters which are used, like amber or gromacs. In NAMD or charmm, one may read in many redundant paremeters, the necessary ones are employed in runtime based on the topology.) The second modification is swapping the charges to the ones representing the charge transfer. In NAMD, that can be done in the psf as well. I suggest borrowing them from ZAFF, the minor changes are within the errors of the forcefield. For instance, the Zn(CYM) 4 site assigns a partial charge of 0.52437 to the zinc, and the CYM sidechains are modified accordingly to have a net of -2 for the moiety. D.
